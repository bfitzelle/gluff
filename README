Welcome to Gluff!

Gluff is the result of an idea by Magnus TÃ¶rnros <magnus.tornros@systeamnat.se>
to collect and collate dhcp logging information from multiple DHCP servers
into a database for later retrieval, and the idea soon grew to the current
design after a number of brainstorming sessions between us.

Gluff was developed for a well-defined purpose: In an environment with
DHCP servers in a failover configuration and switches using DHCP snooping
and option 82 to imprint switch ID and switch port into passing DHCP
requests, it is used to keep track of all leases from start to end,
including the remote-id and circuit-id. It must be possible to determine
where a particular IP address is connected at any given time.

The theory is simple: Unless the failover mechanism is failing, each DHCPACK
sent out, from any DHCP server in the system, denotes an official lease or
lease extension. Thus, for every DHCPACK, our patched dhcpd logs an entry
in a "queue" table in a local sqlite3 database (chosen because it's supposed
to have high performance and be easy to use).

Another process on the DHCP server computer, gluff, regularly consumes
entries from the queue, accesses a MySQL database on a remote server shared
by all the DHCP servers, and figures out whether the entry denotes a new
lease or a lease extension. gluff updates the MySQL database accordingly,
and so the database will contain correct lease records for every distinct
lease ever granted.

This is what you need to do:

On the DB server:

In terms of Ubuntu packages, you will need mysql-server, and you will also probably want to set up
phpmyadmin, which will happily give you apache, php5-mysql and other stuff.

 * Configure mysql to listen to network interfaces - check "bind-address" in /etc/mysql/my.cnf or wherever it is.
 * Create a database (here called dhcpd_leases), and a user with permission to connect from the DHCP servers:
    create database dhcpd_leases
    grant all on dhcpd_leases.* to 'dhcpd'@'192.168.10.10' identified by 'foobar'
    grant all on dhcpd_leases.* to 'dhcpd'@'192.168.11.10' identified by 'foobar'
 * Create the tables, using the commands in dhcpd_leases.sql


On the DHCP servers:

You will want at least the following: libmysqlclient15-dev, libmysqlclient15off, libsqlite3-dev
Optional are mysql-client and sqlite3
To compile stuff, you also need gcc, build-essentials and possibly more stuff, like kernel headers

 * Patch dhcpd-4.1.0a1, build, install and run it with the -ldb parameter to point out an sqlite3 database, here "/var/db/dhcpd_queue.db3"
 * Configure, build and install gluff
 * Run gluff with the following command
       /opt/gluff/bin/gluff -l /var/db/dhcpd_queue.db3 -h 192.168.15.10 -udhcpd -pfoobar -ddhcpd_leases -R
   where 192.168.15.10 is the address of the DB server.

gluff logs to "local2" so you can set up syslog to handle it according to your wishes.
